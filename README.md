# Sensor-layout
The layout and functionality of air quality measurement sensors play a significant role in building control systems and occupant comfort. While prior research has predominantly concentrated on the placement and density of sensors, limited emphasis has been placed on evaluating their accuracy, multifunctionality, and cost-efficiency. To address these factors, this paper proposes an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) bi-model that determines the optimal sensor layout for coverage and cost-efficiency. The ILP model achieves a balance between cost and coverage using a Leader-Follower Approach. This approach enables attaining the required coverage at the lowest possible cost or maximizing coverage within a fixed budget. The proposed bi-model accounts for sensor measurement accuracy at various locations to meet energy efficiency and occupant satisfaction requirements. By combining the ILP bi-model with the Leader-Follower approach, this study reduces computational complexity and runtime without compromising solution accuracy in determining the sensor layout. The results demonstrate the modelâ€™s ability to rapidly identify an optimal sensor configuration that enables coverage assurance and cost efficiency.
